title: Adjust Page Layout Settings
---
In the [Web Report Designer](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer.md), you can change page layout settings before you print a report.
 

To specify the report's page settings, switch to the [Properties Panel](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/interface-elements/properties-panel.md), and in the Report Controls drop-down list, select the report. Expand the **Page Settings** category and adjust the following page settings.

![eud-page-settings-0](../../../../images/Img119977.png)
* **Paper Kind**
	
	You can select one the predefined paper sizes or specify a custom paper size. To create your own paper size, set the **Paper Kind** property to **Custom**, and then specify the **Page Width** and **Page Height** properties.

* **Margins**
	
	To modify page margins, specify the **Margins** property or move sliders on the horizontal and vertical ruler in the report's [Design Surface](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/interface-elements/design-surface.md).

	The margin values are expressed in the report's [measurement units](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/creating-reports/basic-operations/change-measurement-units-of-a-report.md).
* **Roll Paper**
	
	If this flag is enabled, the document is supposed to be printed on a roll of paper (i.e., as a single uninterrupted page). This setting will affect the corresponding page options (such as the [page number](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/creating-reports/add-details-about-a-report/add-page-numbers-and-system-information-to-a-report.md) values), as well as disable page-specific commands in the [Print Preview](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/document-preview.md) (i.e., the **Navigation** and **Multipage Mode** options).
* **Landscape**
	
	This flag determines whether the page orientation is Landscape (when enabled) or Portrait (when disabled).
