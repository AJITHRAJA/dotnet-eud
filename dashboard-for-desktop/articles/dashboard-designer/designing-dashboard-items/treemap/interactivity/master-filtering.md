title: Master Filtering
---
The **Dashboard  Designer** allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items. To learn more, see the [Master Filtering](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity/master-filtering.md) topic, which describes filtering concepts common to all dashboard items.

The Treemap dashboard item supports filtering by tiles/[groups](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/treemap/grouping.md).

When Master Filtering is enabled, you can click a tile or group caption (or multiple tiles/groups by holding down the **CTRL** key) to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected tile/group(s).
