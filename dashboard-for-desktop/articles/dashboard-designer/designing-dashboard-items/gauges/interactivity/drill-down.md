title: Drill-Down
---
The built-in drill-down capability allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in dashboard items on the fly. To learn more about drill-down concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Drill-Down](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity/drill-down.md) topic.

When drill-down is enabled, you can click a gauge to view the details.

> When [Master Filtering](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/gauges/interactivity/master-filtering.md) is enabled, you can view the details by double-clicking a gauge.

Drill-down requires that the **Series** section contains several dimensions, from the least detailed to the most detailed dimension.

> In **OLAP** mode, you can perform drill-down for either a hierarchy data item or several dimension attributes.

To enable drill-down, click the **Drill Down** button in the **Data** Ribbon tab (or the ![DataShaping_Interactivity_DrillDown_Toolbar](../../../../../images/Img19513.png) button if you are using the toolbar menu).

To return to the previous detail level (drill up), use the **Drill Up** button (the ![DrillDown_DrillUpArrow](../../../../../images/Img18627.png) icon) in the [caption](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/dashboard-layout/dashboard-item-caption.md) of the Gauge dashboard item, or the **Drill Up** command in the Gaugeâ€™s context menu.
