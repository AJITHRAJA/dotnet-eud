# Highlighting and Selection Chart Elements
If you are working with 2D charts, you can highlight and select different chart elements via the mouse or using different gestures on your touchscreen device.

## Highlighting
Any chart element that can be selected supports highlighting.

An end user can highlight a chart's area using either the drag gesture on your touchscreen device or via the mouse pointer by hovering over a particular chart element, as shown in the image below.
