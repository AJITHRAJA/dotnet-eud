* In the Classic View, click the **New** button in the [Toolbar](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/interface-elements/toolbar.md).

As a result, the [Report Wizard](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/report-wizard.md) is automatically invoked allowing you to create the required report based on built-in templates.
