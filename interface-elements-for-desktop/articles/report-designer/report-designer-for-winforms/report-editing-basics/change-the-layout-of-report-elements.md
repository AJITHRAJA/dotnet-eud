They can be precisely aligned to each other using the _Snap Gird_ and/or _Snap Lines_. For details on this, refer to [Controls Positioning](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/create-reports/basic-operations/controls-positioning.md).

To resize a control using the mouse, select it, and then drag a rectangle drawn on its edge or corner.

To resize an element using the keyboard, press SHIFT+ARROW or CTRL+SHIFT+ARROW.

To select multiple elements, do one of the following.

You can also easily align multiple controls or make them the same size, by utilizing the [Layout Toolbar](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/layout-toolbar.md).

In addition, to copy, paste and delete controls simultaneously, you can place them within the [Panel](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-controls/panel.md).
