# Image Overview
The Web Dashboard allows you to create two types of **Image** dashboard items.
* The **Image** dashboard item allows you to add a static image to the dashboard.

* The **Bound Image** dashboard item can be bound to a set of images (for instance, stored in the database). You can use the Bound Image as a detail item along with the [Master Filtering](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/interactivity/master-filtering.md) feature.
