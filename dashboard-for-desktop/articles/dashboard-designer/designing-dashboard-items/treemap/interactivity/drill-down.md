title: Drill-Down
---
The built-in drill-down capability allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in dashboard items on the fly. To learn more about drill-down concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Drill-Down](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity/drill-down.md) topic.

When drill-down is enabled, you can click a tile to view its details.

> When [Master Filtering](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity/master-filtering.md) is enabled, you can view the details by double-clicking a tile.

Drill-down requires that the **Arguments** section contains several dimensions, from the least detailed to the most detailed dimension.

> In OLAP mode, you can perform drill-down for either a hierarchy data item or several dimension attributes.

To enable drill-down, click the **Drill Down** button in the **Data** Ribbon tab (or the ![DataShaping_Interactivity_DrillDown_Toolbar](../../../../../images/Img19513.png) button if you are using the toolbar menu).

To return to the previous detail level (drill up), use the **Drill Up** (![DrillDown_DrillUpArrow](../../../../../images/Img18627.png)) button in the caption of the Treemap dashboard item, or the **Drill Up** command in the context menu.

> [Grouping](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/treemap/grouping.md) is not in effect when the drill-down is enabled.
