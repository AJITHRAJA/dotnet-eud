The newly created report will be opened in a separate designer tab.

By default, the created report contains three [bands](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/report-elements/report-bands.md) -  a Page Header, Detail band, and Page Footer.

## Create a New Report Using the Report Wizard
In the [main menu](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/interface-elements/menu.md), click **New via Wizard**.
