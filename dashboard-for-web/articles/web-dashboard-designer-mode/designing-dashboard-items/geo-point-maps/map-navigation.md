The Geo Point Map dashboard item allows you to perform navigation actions such as zooming and scrolling using the mouse.

You can enable or disable the capability to scroll/zoom the map using the **Lock Navigation** option in the Geo Point Map's [Options](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu.

To display the entire map within the dashboard item, use the **Initial Extent** button (the ![wdd-map-initial-size-icon](../../../../images/Img125402.png) icon) in the Geo Point Map's [caption](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/dashboard-layout/dashboard-item-caption.md).
