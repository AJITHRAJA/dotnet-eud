On the [Designer Tab](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/designer-tab.md), multiple reports can be opened at once (each in its own Design Panel).

The Design Panel provides the following tabs (switched at the bottom).
