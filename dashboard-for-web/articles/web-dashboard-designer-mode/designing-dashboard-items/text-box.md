You can provide text by uploading file in the RTF format.

To do this, go to the Text Box's [Options](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu and click the ellipsis button in the **Text** field.

This invokes the Open dialog, which allows you to locate the RTF file.
