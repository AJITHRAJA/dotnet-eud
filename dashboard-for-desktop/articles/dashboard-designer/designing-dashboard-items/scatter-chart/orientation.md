You can rotate the Scatter Chart so that the [X-axis](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/scatter-chart/axes.md) becomes vertical, and the [Y-axis](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/scatter-chart/axes.md) becomes horizontal.

To rotate a Chart in the Designer, use the **Rotate** button in the **Diagram** section of the **Design** Ribbon tab.
