# Interactivity
This document describes the features that enable interaction between the Bound Image and other dashboard items. These features include **Master Filtering**.

## Master Filtering
Data displayed in the Bound Image dashboard item can be filtered by other master filter items. The image below displays the Bound Image dashboard item filtered by [List Box](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/designing-dashboard-items/filter-elements.md).

You can prevent the Bound Image from being affected by other master filter items using the **Ignore Master Filters** button in the Bound Image's [Interactivity](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu.
