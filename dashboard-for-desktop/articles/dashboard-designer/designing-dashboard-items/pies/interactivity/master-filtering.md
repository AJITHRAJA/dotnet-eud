# Master Filtering
The **Dashboard** allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items (**Master Filter**). To learn more about filtering concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Master Filtering](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity/master-filtering.md) topic.

The **Pie** dashboard item supports filtering by **argument** or **series** values.

## Filtering by Arguments
When filtering by arguments is enabled, you can click a pie segment to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected argument value.

To enable filtering by arguments in the Designer, set the required [Master Filter mode](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity/master-filtering.md) and click the **Arguments** button in the **Data** Ribbon tab (or the ![Pies_Interactivity_MasterFilter_Arguments_Toolbar](../../../../../images/Img19919.png) button if you are using the toolbar menu).

## Filtering by Series
When filtering by series is enabled, you can click a pie to make other dashboard items display only data related to the selected pie.
