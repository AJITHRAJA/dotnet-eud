Dashboard provides the **drill-down** feature, which allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in a dashboard item. This feature allows you to drill down to display the details, or drill up to view more general information.

To learn how to drill down using a particular dashboard item, refer to the documentation for this item in the [Dashboard Items](../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-viewer/dashboard-items.md) topic.

To return to the previous detail level (drill up), use the **Drill Up** button (the ![DrillDown_DrillUpArrow](../../../images/Img18627.png) icon) in the dashboard item's [caption](../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-viewer/data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md), or the corresponding command in the context menu.
