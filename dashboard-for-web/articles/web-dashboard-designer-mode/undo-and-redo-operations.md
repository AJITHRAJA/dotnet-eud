# Undo and Redo Operations
The Web Dashboard keeps track of all user actions, and allows you to undo or repeat them using the **Undo**/**Redo** buttons.

To undo/redo the last action, use the following buttons located in the [Toolbox](../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/ui-elements/toolbox.md).
