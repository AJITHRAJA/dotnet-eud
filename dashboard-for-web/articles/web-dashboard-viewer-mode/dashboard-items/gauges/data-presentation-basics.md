The **Gauge** dashboard item displays a series of gauges. Each gauge can communicate two values - one with a needle and the other with a marker on the scale.

The **Gauge** dashboard item can illustrate this difference for various sets of values. You can switch between these sets using the **Values** button (the ![Cards_ValuesIcon](../../../../images/Img22504.png) icon) in the gauge's [caption](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-viewer-mode/data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md).
