# Pie Options
The Pie Map dashboard item allows you to take into account the weight of the pies. In this case, the relative sizes of the pies depend on the corresponding summary values.

To enable this capability, go to the **Common** section of the Pie Map's [Options](../../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu and use the **Weighted Pies** option.
