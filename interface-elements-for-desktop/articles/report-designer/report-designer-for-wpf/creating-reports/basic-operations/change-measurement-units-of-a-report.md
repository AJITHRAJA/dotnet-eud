To specify the **Measure Unit** property, do one of the following.
* Right-click the report and select **Edit...** in the context menu. In the invoked dialog, set this property to the required value.

This defines the basic measurement unit for all the unit-related options of a report and its [bands](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/report-elements/report-bands.md) and [controls](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/report-elements/report-controls.md) (such as location, size, border width, etc.) as well as the measurement unit of the report's [Snap Grid](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/creating-reports/basic-operations/control-positioning.md).
