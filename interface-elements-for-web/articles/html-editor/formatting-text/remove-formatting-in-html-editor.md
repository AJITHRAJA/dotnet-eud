# Remove Formatting in HTML Editor
In some cases, you might wish to remove text formatting (for example, if the editor's content text was pasted from from a Microsoft Word document and contains unnecessary tags).

To remove text formatting, click the editor's **Remove Formatting** button (![ASPxHtmlEditor-Buttons-RemoveFormatting](../../../images/Img7418.png)).

> Note that the **Remove Formatting** button affects the entire text.
