# Label Report
This tutorial describes the steps to create a _label report_ containing employee badges, using the [Report Wizard](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-wizard.md).

To create a label report, do the following.
1. In the [Main Menu](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/main-menu.md), select **File** and click **New via Wizard...** (or press CTRL+W).
2. Next, the Wizard will guide you through the process of creating a label report. For detailed instructions on the wizard's steps, refer to [Label Report](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-wizard/label-report.md).
3. [Bind the report to a data source](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/create-reports/binding-a-report-to-data.md) containing information about employees.
4. Finally, drop the required fields from the [Field List](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/field-list.md) onto the available Detail band's area, and customize their layout.

	Note that you can employ the [mail merge](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-editing-basics/use-mail-merge-in-report-elements.md), to combine multiple data fields within the same control.

The label report is now ready. Switch to the [Preview Tab](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/preview-tab.md), and view the result.
