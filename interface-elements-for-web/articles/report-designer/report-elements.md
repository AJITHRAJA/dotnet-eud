# Report Elements
A report is built from _controls_ (text labels, images, zip codes, charts, etc.) spread across report sections called _bands_ (various headers, footers and content sections). The main interface elements helping you manage these building blocks are [Toolbox](../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/interface-elements/toolbox.md), [Field List](../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/interface-elements/field-list.md) and [Properties Panel](../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/interface-elements/properties-panel.md). These elements allow you add controls to your report, bind them to data and change their appearance and behavior settings, respectively.

To learn more about these report elements used in the [Web Report Designer](../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer.md), see the following topics.
