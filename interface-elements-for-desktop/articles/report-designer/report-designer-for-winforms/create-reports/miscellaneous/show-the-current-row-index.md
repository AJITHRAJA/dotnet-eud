This document describes how to accompany every record in a [data-bound report](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/create-reports/binding-a-report-to-data.md) with its current row index.

To show the current row index in a report, use a [Label](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-controls/label.md) control [bound to a data field](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-editing-basics/displaying-values-from-a-database-(binding-report-elements-to-data).md), and specify its **Summary** options in the following way.
