title: Display Hidden Pivot Table Fields
---
To display hidden fields, use a simple or advanced Field List  (to learn more about Field Lists, see [Field List Overview](../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/pivot-table/field-list-overview.md)).

First, invoke a Field List. For information on how to do this, see [Invoke a Field List](../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/pivot-table/field-list/invoke-a-field-list.md).

To display a hidden field, drag-and-drop the field from the Field List onto the required area of Pivot Table. This works for both simple and advanced Field Lists.

If you are using an advanced Field List, you can display a hidden field by dragging its header from the hidden fields section to the section corresponding to the required Pivot Table area.
