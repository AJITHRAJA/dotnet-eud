## Display Modes
The Properties panel can display element properties in alphabetical flat order or combine them into categories depending on their purposes. To switch between these display modes, use the dedicated buttons.

## Changing Property Values
In the Properties panel, each row consists of two cells: the header cell showing the property caption and the value cell. To set a property value, locate the property and specify its value using the corresponding cell editor. Specific properties contain nested properties, which can be accessed by clicking the expand button for the property captions.

## Searching for Properties
The Properties panel includes the search box that allows you to search for a required property. When you type within the search box, the Properties panel automatically creates a search criteria based on the entered text and filters the list of available properties.

If you type two substrings separated by the space character, these substrings are considered as individual conditions combined by the **OR** logical operator. To find properties that contain both substrings (i.e., to use the **AND** logical operator), type "+" before the second substring. Similarly, type "-" to exclude properties that contain a specific substring. To search for a property that contains a space character, enclose the entered string in quotation marks. You can also combine several logical operators and quotation marks.
