# Report Bands
The documents in this section details the available kinds of report bands and their settings.

In the Report Designer, a report is built upon _bands_ - sections of varied type and purpose, where [report controls](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-controls.md) are contained. Bands are featured in the [Designer Tab](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/designer-tab.md), solely to represent different sections of a report document (such as detail, report or page header, or footer). They allow you to select exactly where a control should be printed, and how many times.

## Band Types
The following band types are available.
* [Detail Band](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/detail-band.md)
* [Group Header and Footer](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/grouping-bands.md)
* [Report Header and Footer](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/report-header-and-footer.md)
* [Page Header and Footer](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/page-header-and-footer.md)

* [Detail Report Band (for Master-Detail Reports)](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/detail-report-band-for-master-detail-reports.md)
* [Sub-Bands](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/sub-bands.md)

## Manage Bands
To manage bands in a report, click its [Smart Tag](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/smart-tag.md), and in the invoked actions list, click the **Edit and Reorder Bands...** link.

Then, in the invoked **Report Editor** you can easily add, remove and reorder bands, and adjust their options.

To quickly insert a band of any type (except for the [Detail band](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/detail-band.md), since it is required in a report), right-click anywhere on a report's surface, and in the invoked [Context Menu](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/context-menu.md), point to **Insert Band**, and choose the band type.
