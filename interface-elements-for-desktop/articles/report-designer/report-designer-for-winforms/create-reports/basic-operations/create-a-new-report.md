title: Create a New Report
---
This topic explains how to create a new blank report in the Report Designer. Before you start, make sure to [back up the current report](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-editing-basics/back-up-the-current-layout-before-modifying-it.md).

To create a new report, do one of the following.

## Create a New Blank Report
In the [Main Menu](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/main-menu.md), click **File** and then **New** (or press CTRL+N).

The [Main Toolbar](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/main-toolbar.md) contains a button (![RD_Toolbars_Main_New](../../../../../images/Img8412.png)) with the same function.

If there is another report already loaded in the designer, you may be prompted whether it should be saved before it is replaced with a newly created report.

By default, the created report contains three [bands](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands.md) - [Page Header and Footer](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/page-header-and-footer.md), and the [Detail band](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/detail-band.md).

## Create a New Report Using the Report Wizard
In the [Main Menu](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/main-menu.md), click **File** and then **New via Wizard...** (or press CTRL+W).
