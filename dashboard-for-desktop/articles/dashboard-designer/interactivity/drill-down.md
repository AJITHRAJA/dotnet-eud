# Drill-Down
Dashboard provides the **Drill-Down** feature, which allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in a dashboard item. The Drill-Down feature enables users to drill down to display detail data, or drill up to view more general information.

Drill-down requires that the [data section](../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/binding-dashboard-items-to-data/binding-dashboard-items-to-data.md) contains several dimensions...

... or a hierarchy data item (in [OLAP mode](../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/binding-dashboard-items-to-data/binding-dashboard-items-to-data-in-olap-mode.md)).

To enable drill-down, click the **Drill-Down** button in the **Data** Ribbon tab (or the ![DataShaping_Interactivity_DrillDown_Toolbar](../../../images/Img19513.png) button if you are using the toolbar menu).

> If the selected dashboard item contains several types of elements that can be used for drill-down, the Ribbon or Toolbar will provide the appropriate buttons to switch between these types (e.g., **Arguments** and **Series** buttons in a Chart). For details, refer to the documentation for the individual dashboard items in the [Designing Dashboard Items](../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items.md) topic.
