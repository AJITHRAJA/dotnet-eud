Perform the following steps to design a dashboard item.
* [Bind](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/binding-dashboard-items-to-data/binding-dashboard-items-to-data.md) the dashboard item to data.
* Perform the required [data shaping](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/data-shaping.md) operations (such as grouping, sorting and filtering).
* Use the [interactivity](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity.md) features to enable interaction between various dashboard items.
* Adjust the dashboard item's [position and size](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/dashboard-layout/dashboard-items-layout.md) and specify the [dashboard item caption](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/dashboard-layout/dashboard-item-caption.md) settings.
* Specify specific dashboard item settings based on its type. To learn more, see [Designing Dashboard Items](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items.md).

After you have created and designed the dashboard item, you can create an exact copy. To do this, click the **Duplicate** button in the **Home** ribbon tab...
