# Cross-band Box
The **Cross-band Box** control allows you to draw a rectangle through several [bands](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands.md). This can be useful if it is required to visually encompass a section consisting of multiple band areas.

Another cross-band control available is the [Cross-band Line](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-controls/cross-band-line.md).

In the [Property Grid](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/property-grid.md), the Cross-band Box control's properties are divided into the following groups.

## Appearance
* **Borders**, **Border Color**, **Border Dash Style** and **Border Width**
	
	Specify border settings for the control.

## Behavior
* **Anchor Horizontally**
	
	Specifies the horizontal anchoring style of the control, so that after page rendering it stays attached to the left control, right control, or both. This property defines how a report control is resized to maintain the distance to the left and right edges of its container control.
* **Anchor Vertically**
	
	Specifies the vertical anchoring style of the control, so that after page rendering it stays attached to the top control, bottom control, or both.
* **Can Publish**
	
	Specifies whether or not a report control is displayed in a printed or exported document.
* **Visible**
	
	Specifies whether the control should be visible in print preview.

## Data
* **Tag**
	
	This property allows you to add some additional information to the control; for example its id, by which it can then be accessible via [scripts](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/create-reports/miscellaneous/handle-events-via-scripts.md).

## Design
* **(Name)**
	
	Determines a control's name, by which it can be accessed in the [Report Explorer](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/report-explorer.md), [Property Grid](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/property-grid.md) or via [scripts](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/create-reports/miscellaneous/handle-events-via-scripts.md).

## Layout
* **End Band**
	
	Determines a band, in which the control finishes drawing.
* **End Point**
	
	Determines the end point (from a band's upper left corner) where the control finishes drawing.
* **Snap Line Margin**
	
	Specifies the margin (measured in [report units](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/create-reports/basic-operations/change-measurement-units-of-a-report.md)), which is to be preserved around the control when it is [aligned using Snap Lines](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/create-reports/basic-operations/controls-positioning.md), or when other controls are aligned next to it.
* **Start Band**
	
	Determines a band,  in which the control starts drawing.
* **Start Point**
	
	Determines the starting point (from a band's upper left corner) where the control starts drawing.
* **Width**
	
	Specifies the width of the Box, measured in [report units](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/create-reports/basic-operations/change-measurement-units-of-a-report.md).
