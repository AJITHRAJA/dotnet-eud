The Text Box dashboard item can be [bound to data](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/binding-dashboard-items-to-data.md) as other data-aware dashboard items. To do this, perform the following steps.
1. Drop the _Name_, _RetailPrice_ and _Description_ data source fields from the _Products_ table to the **Values** section of the Text Box.

	Note that [summary types](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/data-shaping/summarization.md) of the created measures are **Min**, **Sum** and **Min**, respectively.
2. Click the [Edit](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/text-box/editing-text.md) button in the **Design** ribbon tab and add the _Name_, _Retail Price_ and _Description_ strings to the document.

Place the pointer next to _Name_, right-click the document and select **Insert Field** (or use the [Insert Field](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/text-box/editing-text.md) button in the ribbon). Then, click the _Select value_ placeholder and select the _Name (Min)_ measure.
