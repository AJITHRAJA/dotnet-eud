title: Specify a Connection String
---
> This wizard step appears only if you're creating a new report from scratch. If you're modifying an existing report, this step will not appear and you will start with the [Choose Columns to Display in Your Report](../../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-wizard/data-bound-report/choose-columns-to-display-in-your-report.md) wizard page.

On this page, you can either use the default connection string or manually specify a connection sting. Additionally, this page requires you to specify whether or not to save the connection string in the configuration file.
