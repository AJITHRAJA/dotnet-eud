# Update Table of Contents
If you have added, removed or modified TOC entries in your document, you can quickly update the TOC in one of the following ways.
* Place the cursor in the TOC and press **F9**.
* Place the cursor in the TOC and click the **Update Table** button on the **Table of Contents** [toolbar](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/rich-text-editor/text-editor-ui/toolbars.md).
* Select **Update Field** from the context menu.

> Note that if the Table of Contents contains hyperlinks (TOC is created using the **{TOC \h}** field code), you should position mouse pointer at the upper left corner of the table to have an effect on entire TOC rather than on a particular hyperlink.
