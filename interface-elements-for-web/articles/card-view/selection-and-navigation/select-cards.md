# Select Cards
If multiple card selection is allowed by the application vendor, you can select multiple cards by doing one of the following.
* Click a card while holding the CTRL key. This toggles a card's selected state without affecting other cards.
* If selection check boxes are visible, check cards that need to be selected.

To select all cards between the clicked card and the previously focused card, click a card while holding the SHIFT key. In this case, the previous selection is cleared.
