The **Card** dashboard item displays a series of cards. Each card illustrates the difference between two values. This difference can be expressed as an absolute value, an absolute variation or a percentage variation.

The **Card** dashboard item can illustrate this difference for various sets of values. You can switch between these sets using the **Values** button (the ![DashboardItems_OtherElements](../../../../images/Img20169.png) icon) in the dashboard item [caption](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-viewer/data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md) area or in the context menu.

## Tooltip
A **Card** dashboard item can display a tooltip for cards containing a sparkline. When the mouse pointer is hovered over the sparkline, the tooltip can display start/end values and minimum/maximum values.
