Most report elements have **Smart Tags** that provide easy access to the most frequently used settings. Clicking an element's Smart Tag invokes an actions list with action links and editors, allowing you to customize this element.
* **Report Smart Tag**
	
	A report's Smart Tag icon is located at the top left corner of the [Design Panel](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/design-panel.md).

* **Band Smart Tag**
	
	A band's Smart Tag icon is located on the band strip right next to its caption. For instance, the Smart Tag for the [Page Header](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/page-header-and-footer.md) is shown in the following image.
