The **Backspace** key deletes one character to the left of the caret. The **Delete** key deletes one character to the right of the caret.

To delete more than just a few characters, [select text](../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/rich-text-editor/text-editing/select-text.md) and press the **Delete** key.
