To move a field to a different position within the same area, you can also use a field context menu.

You can also use a Field List to reorder fields. For more information, see [Reorder Fields Using a Field List](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/pivot-table/layout-customization/reorder-fields/reorder-fields-using-a-field-list.md).
