# Toolbar
The **toolbar** is a set of toolbar buttons, which perform common tasks in HTML content editing and formatting. Most toolbar buttons work in the same manner as in Microsoft Word.

Each standard toolbar button has its own tooltip, invoked while the button is hovered with the mouse cursor. Some buttons have a selected mode, which indicates the active state of the button.
