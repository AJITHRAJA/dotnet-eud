The document preview allows you to check the print output of a report and customize its additional options using the [Preview Toolbar](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/document-preview/preview-toolbar.md). The report can be then exported to different third-party formats, sent using e-mail or printed.

Different elements of the Report Designer's preview are covered in the following documents.
* [Preview Toolbar](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/document-preview/preview-toolbar.md)
* [Export Document Dialog](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/document-preview/export-document-dialog.md)
* [Parameters Panel](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/document-preview/parameters-panel.md)
* [Search Panel](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/document-preview/search-panel.md)
* [Document Map Panel](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/document-preview/document-map-panel.md)
