# Map Types Overview
The **Dashboard Designer** allows you to create three types of **Geo Point** maps.
* The **[Geo Point Map](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/geo-point-maps/geo-point-map.md)** dashboard item allows you to place callouts on the map using geographical coordinates.

* The **[Bubble Map](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/geo-point-maps/bubble-map.md)** dashboard item allows you to place bubbles on the map. Each bubble can represent data using its weight and color.

* The **[Pie Map](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/geo-point-maps/pie-map.md)** dashboard item allows you to display pies on the map. Each pie visualizes the contribution of each value to the total.
