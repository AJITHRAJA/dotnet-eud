title: Static Report
---
This tutorial describes the steps needed to create a _static report_, which means that the report is not bound to a data source. This example demonstrates how to create a report with the one-page content repeated 20 times.

To create a static report, do the following.
1. [Create a new report](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/creating-reports/basic-operations/create-a-new-report.md).
2. Drop the [Rich Text](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/report-elements/report-controls.md) control from the [Toolbox](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/interface-elements/control-toolbox.md) onto the [Detail band](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/report-elements/report-bands.md).

3. Right-click the created control and select **Load File...** in the invoked context menu.

4. In the invoked dialog, use the drop-down list to define the file's extension (**.rtf**, **.docx**, **.txt**, **.htm** or **.html**), select the file, and click **Open**.
5. Select the report, and in the [Properties Panel](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/interface-elements/properties-panel.md), expand the **Report Print Options** property. Make sure that the **Print when Data Source is Empty** option is enabled, i.e., the report is allowed to be printed when it has no data source. To repeat the created report 20 times, set the **Detail Count when Data Source is Empty** property to **20**.

6. To print the report content on separate pages, set the band's **Page Break** property to **After the Band**.

The static report is now ready. Switch to the [Print Preview](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/document-preview.md) tab and view the result.
