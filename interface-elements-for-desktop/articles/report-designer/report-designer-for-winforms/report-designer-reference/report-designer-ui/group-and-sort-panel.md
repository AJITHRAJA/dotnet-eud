# Group and Sort Panel
The **Group and Sort Panel** allows you to quickly apply [grouping](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-editing-basics/change-or-apply-data-grouping-to-a-report.md) and [sorting](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-editing-basics/change-or-apply-data-sorting-to-a-report.md) to your report data.

To create a new grouping or sorting criterion, simply click **Add a Group** or **Add a Sort**.

Then, to control whether the corresponding [Group Header or Footer band](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-bands/grouping-bands.md) should be seen, use the **Show Header** and **Show Footer** check boxes.

The **Sort Order** drop-down list allows you to specify a sorting mode (ascending or descending) or disable sorting.

You can change the order in which multiple grouping and sorting criteria are to be performed, via the **Move Up** and **Move Down** buttons.

To remove a grouping or sorting criterion, select it, and click **Delete**.

> If the Group and Sort Panel is hidden, you can enable it in the [Main Menu](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/main-menu.md), by selecting **View** | **Windows** | **Group and Sort**.
