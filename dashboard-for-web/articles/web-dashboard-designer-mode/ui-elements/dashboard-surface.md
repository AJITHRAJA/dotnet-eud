# Dashboard Surface
The **Dashboard Surface** is a rectangular area that displays the dashboard that you are designing. This area includes [dashboard items](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/designing-dashboard-items.md) and the [dashboard title](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/dashboard-layout/dashboard-title.md).

You can customize a [dashboard items layout](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/dashboard-layout/dashboard-items-layout.md) using drag-and-drop operations, and specify dashboard item settings using its [dashboard item menu](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md).
