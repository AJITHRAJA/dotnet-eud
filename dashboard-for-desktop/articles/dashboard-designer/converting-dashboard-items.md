# Converting Dashboard Items
The Dashboard Designer provides the capability to convert data-bound dashboard items to another type. To convert the selected dashboard item to another type, use the **Convert** button in the ribbon's **Home** tab or the corresponding command in the item's context menu.

The Dashboard Designer always preserves the following settings for data-bound dashboard items.
* The set of [data items](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/binding-dashboard-items-to-data.md) used to bind the dashboard item to data.
* [Data shaping](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/data-shaping.md) settings of data items and their names.
* A custom name displayed within the dashboard item [caption](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/dashboard-layout/dashboard-item-caption.md).

The following settings are kept if the dashboard item is being converted to an item that also supports this feature.
* [Master Filtering](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity/master-filtering.md) settings (e.g., the specified master filter mode) and [Drill-Down](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity/drill-down.md) settings (e.g., the target dimension).
* [Conditional Formatting](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/appearance-customization/conditional-formatting.md) settings.
* [Coloring](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/appearance-customization/coloring.md) settings.
* [Calculation](../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/data-analysis/window-calculations.md) settings.
