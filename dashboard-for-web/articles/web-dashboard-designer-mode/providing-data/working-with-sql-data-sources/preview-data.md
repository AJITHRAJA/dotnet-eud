# Preview Data
The [Dashboard Data Source Wizard](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/providing-data/working-with-sql-data-sources/pass-query-parameters.md) and [Query Builder](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/providing-data/working-with-sql-data-sources/query-builder.md) allow you to preview data returned after a query/[stored procedure](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/providing-data/working-with-sql-data-sources/stored-procedures.md) execution. To do this, click the **Preview...** button.
